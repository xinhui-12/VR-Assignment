This is my BACS3063 Virtual Reality Assignment. This is a VR interior design application that can benefit the area of architecture through the implementation of VR technology. The user can choose whether in a house or in a school. Then, the user can select the furnitures and place them based on the user's preference. The furnitures can also be rotated and scaled.

<br/>Any suggestions are welcomed ;)
